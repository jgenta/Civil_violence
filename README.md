## General Introduction

As recent revolutions in northern Africa have shown, media has a big impact on the dynamics of insurgencies. It promotes for example the organization of revolutionary groups and events.
It is therefore of great interest to analyze the influence of the information provided by media on the behavior of single people and the group dynamics.
This effect of media has an emerging importance on modeling social behavior. Especially in developing countries, where oppressive governments prevented the creation of large revolutionary groups, new social media is having a deep impact in connecting people sharing the same ideals.


## The Model

The model used is an agent-based model on civil violence. 
On a 2-D matrix representing a geographical area, two kinds of actors are placed with a certain probability.
One group is the general population (agents) where each individual can be either active or inactive depending on exogeneous variables.
Being active correponds to protest actively in a criminal way against the government.
The other group is composed by cops arresting active protestors within their reach.
The following variables influence the behaviour of the actors:
- Density of actors;
- Hardship, legitimacy of the governments and risk aversion of the individual affects the probability of an agent being active;
- Vision which defines how much actors are influenced by the environment;
- Amount of time steps that an agent spends in jail after he's arrested;

In order to implement the effects of media, two different ways are proposed:
- Increasing the field of vision of agents;
- Modifying the way people move to allow them to gather in bigger groups.




## Fundamental Questions

1.       How big is the impact of information availability in revolutionary actions?
- Do media actually promote insurgencies and in which way? Do media play a role in increasing the frequency at which these insurgencies arise?
- Are people encouraged to be violent if they can rapidly be supported by other groups through social networks for example?
- Is therefore information availability an obstacle for oppressive governments that want to have the population under control?
2.       How can organization within the population affect insurgencies?
3.       How do localized insurgencies influence the behavior of single people?
- What happens if they are attracted?
- How does the revolution evolve?



## Expected Results

- Media work as catalyzer for revolutions since they represent a way of coordinate actions
- Media also have the capability of spreading information, so encouraging insurgences
- Organized revolutions are harder to suppress than random civil violence occurrances
- Big groups of revolutionaries act as an attractor for repressed people
